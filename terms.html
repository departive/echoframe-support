    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 26, 2026</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to Echo Frame. By downloading, installing, or using the Echo Frame application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using Echo Frame, you confirm that you are at least 13 years of age and agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Echo Frame is a photo-to-music discovery application that analyzes your photos using artificial intelligence to suggest songs that match the visual mood, tone, and atmosphere of your images. The App integrates with Apple Music to provide playback functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>3. AI-Generated Content and Recommendations</h2>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Song recommendations are generated by artificial intelligence and are inherently subjective. Results will vary and may not always align with your personal expectations.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Song suggestions are generated by third-party AI technology (Google Gemini) and are <strong>subjective interpretations</strong> of visual content</li>
        <li>The perceived "match" between a photo and a song is inherently subjective and varies from person to person</li>
        <li>We <strong>do not guarantee</strong> that suggestions will meet your expectations, preferences, or standards</li>
        <li>AI-generated recommendations may occasionally be unexpected, unconventional, or feel mismatched—this is a natural characteristic of AI systems</li>
        <li>The quality, relevance, or accuracy of song suggestions is <strong>not grounds for refunds</strong></li>
        <li>We have no control over and accept no liability for the specific songs, artists, or genres suggested by the AI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using Echo Frame, you accept that AI recommendations are experimental and creative in nature, and you use them at your own discretion.</p>

    <h2>4. AI Evolution and Output Variance</h2>
    <p>Echo Frame utilizes a proprietary AI-driven curation system (the "Echo Engine") and the <strong>Resonance Framework</strong> to generate music suggestions based on the material properties of your photographs. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suggestions are subjective and based on a combination of visual analysis, the Resonance Framework, and available music metadata</li>
        <li>The Echo Engine is under continuous development; its logic and matching capabilities are subject to ongoing improvement and change</li>
        <li>In <strong>Library Mode</strong>, results are constrained by the depth and diversity of your linked music library. A smaller or less varied library may produce less precise pairings</li>
        <li>We do not guarantee a "perfect" match for every image, and results may vary between sessions as the engine evolves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Accounts and Data</h2>
    <p>Echo Frame does not require you to create an account. Your preferences and saved Echoes are stored locally on your device. If you choose to connect Apple Music, your library data is used solely to personalize song recommendations and is processed in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Echo Frame Pro subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Echo Frame offers the following subscription options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Echo Frame Pro (Monthly):</strong> A recurring monthly subscription providing unlimited Echoes, Discovery Mode, and premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>Echo Frame Pro (Lifetime):</strong> A one-time purchase providing permanent access to all Pro features.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Payment:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Managing Subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your App Store account settings. Go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions on your iOS device.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> All purchases are processed by Apple. Refund requests must be submitted through Apple's support channels in accordance with their refund policies. Dissatisfaction with AI-generated song recommendations does not constitute grounds for a refund, as the subjective nature of recommendations is disclosed prior to purchase.</p>
