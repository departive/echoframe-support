## FAQs

### Why can't I play songs?
Echo Frame requires an Apple Music subscription to play full tracks. Make sure you've granted Apple Music access in Settings.

### Why are my recommendations not matching my taste?
Make sure to scan your music library in the Profile tab. This helps Echo Frame understand your preferences.

### How do I delete my data?
Go to Settings → Reset App to clear all your Echoes and start fresh.
