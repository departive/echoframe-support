# Privacy Policy for Echo Frame

**Last updated: February 2025**

## Overview

Echo Frame is designed with privacy at its core. Your photos and music preferences stay on your device.

## Data Collection

**What we access:**
- Photos you select for analysis (processed in real-time, never stored on servers)
- Your Apple Music library (to personalize song recommendations)

**What we DO NOT do:**
- We do not store your photos on any server
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties
- We do not track your location
- We do not collect personal information

## How It Works

When you analyze a photo, it is sent to our AI service (Google Gemini) to find matching music. The image is processed immediately and not retained.

Your music library data stays entirely on your device and is only used to personalize recommendations.

## Data Storage

- All your Echoes (photo-music matches) are stored locally on your device
- Your Sonic DNA profile is generated and stored on your device
- No cloud sync, no external databases

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at: **your@email.com**

## Changes

We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
